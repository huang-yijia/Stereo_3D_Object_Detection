# Stereo 3D Object Detection

This project presents a modular pipeline for 3D Object Detection, integrating object detection, depth estimation, and 3D bounding box projection. The object detection module supports both a YOLOv11-based approach inspired by Faster-RCNN and a transformer-based approach using DETR. For depth estimation, it includes both Depth Anything v2 for monocular depth estimation and a stereo camera-based depth estimation algorithm that leverages binocular disparity to recover scene depth more accurately. The final 3D bounding box module combines 2D detection results with depth information to generate spatially aware 3D boxes, complete with Birdâ€™s Eye View (BEV) visualization and pseudo-3D overlays. This pipeline is designed to be flexible and extensible for future research and experimentation in 3D perception.
